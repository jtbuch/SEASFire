# seasonal_fire_pred_proj

Combining a statistical climate variable prediction model with [SMLFire1.0](https://github.com/jtbuch/smlfire1.0) to produce seasonal fire frequency and burned area forecasts.

Future iterations will extend this framework to other fire response variables such as: fire intensity and biomass emissions.
