# SEASFire: Seasonal and subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasts of fire activity in the western US

Combining a statistical climate variable prediction model with [SMLFire1.0](https://github.com/jtbuch/smlfire1.0) to produce seasonal fire frequency and burned area forecasts. A preliminary forecast of fire probability for summer 2022 using observations until May 2022 is shown below:

Future iterations will extend this framework to other fire response variables such as fire intensity and biomass emissions.
